        </center>

        Highly motivated software engineer with a penchant for Linux and Full Stack Development. Lots of the skills I have
        used in my projects were self-taught, including C++, Xlib, REST, ECS, and a few design patterns.<br><br>

        I'm mainly interested in kernel development and system software programming.<br><br><br>
